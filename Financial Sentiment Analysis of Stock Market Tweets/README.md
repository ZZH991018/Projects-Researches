## Zhaohong Zhang

### NLP Project

This project examines sentiment analysis in the financial domain, focusing on tweets related to the top 25 most-watched stock tickers on Yahoo Finance. Multiple machine learning and deep learning models, including the Random Forest model, XGBoost, LightGBM with TF-IDF features, and a deep Learning Model (CNN), are evaluated for sentiment classification and stock price prediction. The models are trained and tested on the sentiment-labeled tweet data, and their performance is compared using standard classification metrics. The project aims to discover and highlight powerful sentiment analysis models in the stock market.
